Additionally, PR-CRM acts as air traffic control between new leads coming in (from web or live transfer), recent leads that need followup, old leads needing some love, and existing customer service calls.

PR-CRM can integrate with your existing phone system with 0 interruption or configuration needed by anyone. The PR-CRM can route all of it’s inbound and outbound calls through your existing phone system regardless of who the provider is. Remember, PR-CRM is still pretty effective without any communication abilities.",

  paragraphs: [
    "Most lead vendors fall into one of two categories: they either have high quality at an expensive low volume, or high volume and low quality. ProspectRoute has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop the next generation in insurance marketing: a high volume system that delivers prospects that close.",
    "ProspectRoute uses leads from several sources - social media, web, lead lists and more - and prequalifies each lead by phone to ensure it’s a perfect match for your agency. We collect essential information such as the address, location, driver information, vehicle information, driving history (self-reported) and more and if the lead matches your criteria we pass it along to you, digitally.",
    "If you use our optional CRM, called the PR-CRM, to manage your leads the CRM instantly places a call to that lead and connects your producer with the opportunity. If no producer is available the CRM will connect the call immediately when the next producer is available. PR’s position is that generating the lead is only half the battle. If you choose, you can receive the PR-CRM free with ProspectRoute when you’re enrolled to receive leads. PR-CRM’s technology is built on the Unifyy platform and helps automate sales from many lead vendors, not just ProspectRoute."
